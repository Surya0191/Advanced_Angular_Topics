    <h2>DOM Sanitizer Demo</h2>

    <p>
        This example demonstrates how Angular's DOM Sanitizer handles potentially unsafe HTML.
        Without sanitization, Angular removes scripts to prevent security risks.
        With sanitization, we manually trust the HTML using <code>bypassSecurityTrustHtml()</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>❌ Without DOM Sanitizer</h3>
    <p>
        Angular automatically **removes unsafe content** such as scripts to **prevent XSS attacks**.
    </p>
    <div class="box" [innerHTML]="unsafeHtml"></div>

    <h3>✅ With DOM Sanitizer</h3>
    <p>
        Here, we use <code>sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml()</code> to **manually trust** the content.
        This **keeps the original HTML intact**, but can be dangerous if not handled carefully.
    </p>
    <div class="box" [innerHTML]="sanitizedHtml"></div>
